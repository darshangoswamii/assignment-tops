5 What do you understand By Data Redundancy?
Data redundancy is a situation where data is stored in multiple locations, making it easier to recover in case  
of data loss or corruption.

What are the benefits of data redundancy?

 
A. Improved data availability: With data redundancy, you can access your data even if one or more storage devices fail.

B. Enhanced data security: Redundant data can be used to detect and correct errors

C. Simplified data recovery: In case of data loss or corruption, you can easily recover your data from the redundant copies.


What are the types of data redundancy?

A. Data Duplication: This occurs when the same data is stored in multiple locations, such as when a customer's name and address are stored in both the sales and marketing databases.

B. Data Inconsistency: This occurs when different versions of the same data exist in different locations, such as when a customer's address is updated in one database but not in another.

C. Data Replication: This occurs when data is intentionally duplicated in multiple locations to improve data availability and performance, such as when data is replicated across multiple servers in a distributed database.

D. Data Redundancy in Data Storage: This occurs when data is stored in a way that is redundant or unnecessary, such as when a database stores both a person's age and their date of birth.

E. Data Redundancy in Data Transmission: This occurs when data is transmitted multiple times over a network, such as when a file is sent multiple times over the internet.
